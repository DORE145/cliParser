Mahjong is what could be described as the eastern equivalent to poker, albeit different in quite a few ways.

It's a 4-player game played with a set of 136 tiles. At the beginning of each round each player will draw 14 tiles from the set at random. The players will then take turns discarding one tile at a time and drawing a new one from the set until one player manages to complete a hand or all 136 tiles have been drawn, in which case the round will end as a draw. A hand is generally comprised from 4 melds (usually a group of 3 sequential tiles such as a 2-3-4 or 3 identical tiles such as a 4-4-4) and one pair (self-explanatory, two of the same tile).
