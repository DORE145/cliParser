According to the Valencian historian Escolano, the first settlers of the region of Cheste were members of Iberian tribes belonging to the old Edetania. This view is supported by numerous remains, particularly those of El Castillarejo (Iberian ceramics and spear points from the Bronze Age).

The Cheste hoard, a cache of gold jewellery and silver coins, was discovered in the locality of La Safa in 1864. The presence of Carthaginian coinage issued by the Barcids alongside an early Roman denarius implies the hoard dates to around the time of the Second Punic War
